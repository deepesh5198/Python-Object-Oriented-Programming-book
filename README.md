My notes of Python Object Oriented Programming book by Steven F. Lott and Dusty Phillips

This book teaches us how to build robust and maintainable Object Oriented Python applications.

<h1>Chapter 1 - Object Oriented Design</h1>
</a>

This chapter introduces the core concepts underlying object-oriented design. This provides a road map through the ideas of state and behavior, attributes and methods, and how objects are grouped into classes. This chapter also gives a brief introduction to encapsulation, inheritance, and composition.

### What does Object Oriented mean?
*Objects* in software development means a collection of **data** and **behaviors** associated with them. And *Oriented* in english dictionary means *directed towards*. So, combiningly Object-Oriented Programming means writing code directed towards modeling objects.

Before writing OOP code there are two more steps. **Object Oriented Analysis** and **Object Oriented Design** that if done can make Object Oriented Programming much easier.

### What is Object Oriented Analysis (OOA)?
- It is the process of looking at a problem, system, or task (that somebody wants to turn into aworking software application) and identifying the objects and interactions between those objects. 
- It is all about *what needs to be done*.
- The output of the analysis stage is a description of the system, often in the form of requirements.

### What is Object Oriented Design (OOD)?
- It is the process of converting the output of the OOA stage (i.e, description of the system, which are often in form of requirements) into an implementation specification.
- In this stage we, name the objects, define the behaviors, and formally specify which objects can activate specific behaviors on other objects.
- The design stage is all about transforming *what should be done?* into *how it should be done?*
- The output of this stage is, turning the requirements defined during object-oriented analysis into a set of **classes** and **interfaces** that could be implemented in some Object Oriented Programming language (in our case Python).

### Finally Object Oriented Programming, what is it?
- It is the process of converting a design that came out from OOD stage,  into a working program.
